# BUPA FE Code challenge

This README file provides instructions on how to run a Vite FE application located in the root project directory and a server located in the `server` folder. The server includes npm run start and test commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Vite app and the server, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Vite App

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

3. Start the Vite application by running the following command:

`npm run dev`

This command will start the development server for the Vite application. You can access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. To build the Vite application for production, you can use the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

## Running the Server

1. Navigate to the `server` folder using your terminal:

`cd server`

2. Install the server's dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

3. Start the server by running the following command:

`npm run start`

This will start the server, and it should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

To run tests for the server, you can use the following command:

`npm run test`

This command will execute the tests for the server and provide feedback on the test results.

## Additional Information

- You can customize the Vite app by editing the files in the project's root directory, including `src/` for your application code.

- For server configuration and code, you can explore the `server/` directory.

- Make sure to refer to the documentation and README files in both the root project and the `server` directory for more detailed information on configuration and usage.

That's it! You should now be able to run the Vite app and the server for your project. If you encounter any issues, please check the error messages in the terminal for guidance on resolving them.
